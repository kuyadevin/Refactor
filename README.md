# Refactor
For this project I was tasked with refactor a webpage in order to imporve its quality.

## Requirements
This project had to meet these following requirments in order to fit the Acceptance Criteria:
-Meets accessibility standards when looking at the source code
-Has semantic HTML elements
-Elements follow a logical structure
-Find accessible alt atributes for icons and images
-Headings fall into sequential order
-Title elements are concise and descriptive

### Programs Used
For this refactor the only programs used were HTML and CSS.

### Examples of Changes
One example of a change I made in order to refactor this website is fixing the navigation bar by adding an ID tag so the navigation bar knows where to go.

One major change I also made to this app was add alt tags to all of the images as they all lacked one.
